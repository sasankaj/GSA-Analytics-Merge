The United States has about 770 million acres of rangelands. Private individuals own more than half of the Nation's rangelands. The federal government manages 43 percent of the rangelands. State and local governments manage the remainder.

The Forest Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, administers approximately 191 million acres of National Forest Systems lands. About half of this acreage, 96 million acres, is rangelands.

These diverse ecosystems produce an equally diverse array of tangible and intangible products. Tangible products include forage for grazing and browsing animals, wildlife habitat, water, minerals, energy, recreational opportunities, some wood products, and plant and animal genes. These are important economic goods. Rangelands produce intangible products such as natural beauty and wilderness, satisfying important societal values.

confined situations. AFOs congregate animals, feed, manure and urine,

brought to the animals rather than the animals grazing or otherwise 
seeking feed in pastures, fields, or on rangeland. There are 
approximately 450,000 AFOs in the United States.

A CAFO is another EPA term for a large concentrated AFO.  A CAFO is 
an AFO with more than 1000 animal units (an animal unit is defined as an
 animal equivalent of 1000 pounds live weight and equates to 1000 head 
of beef cattle, 700 dairy cows, 2500 swine weighing more than 55 lbs, 
125 thousand broiler chickens, or 82 thousand laying hens or pullets) 
confined on site for more than 45 days during the year.  Any size AFO 
that discharges manure or wastewater into a natural or man-made ditch, 
stream or other waterway is defined as a CAFO, regardless of size.  
CAFOs are regulated by EPA under the Clean Water Act in both the 2003 
and 2008 versions of the ""CAFO"" rule.



USDA’s goal is for AFO/CAFO owners and operators to take voluntary 
actions to minimize potential air and water pollutants from storage
